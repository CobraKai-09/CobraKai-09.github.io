        <p>I'm auditioning for the jazz band, and I worked really hard to get ready for it. Every day, I practiced my instrument, focused on getting better, and tried to learn more about jazz music. I asked for help when I needed it and kept going even when it was tough. I always try to give my best effort, and this audition was no different. No matter what happens, I’m proud of how hard I worked and how much I’ve improved. I am also working on maintaining a 4.0 GPA throughout my whole high school journey.</p>
